# Basic CPU Components

## Week 3: Basic CPU Components

### Objective:
- Implement core components of the CPU.

### Tasks:
1. **Build the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**:
   - The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations like addition, subtraction, AND, OR, etc.

2. **Implement general-purpose registers**:
   - Create registers that store intermediate values during computation.

3. **Create the program counter (PC) and instruction register (IR)**:
   - The PC tracks the current instruction's memory address.
   - The IR holds the instruction currently being executed.
