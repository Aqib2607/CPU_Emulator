## About the Project
The **Virtual CPU Emulator** is a software-based CPU simulator designed for educational purposes. 
It aims to emulate the basic functionalities of a CPU, including instruction processing, 
memory management, and I/O operations. The project provides an environment to learn and 
experiment with the inner workings of CPU architecture and design principles.

## Features
- Simulates core CPU components (ALU, registers, memory, etc.).
- Implements an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) with basic operations like ADD, SUB, LOAD, and STORE.
- Includes a simple assembler to convert assembly code into machine code.
- Provides tools for debugging, performance analysis, and optimization.
- Simulated I/O devices (e.g., keyboard and display).
- Support for advanced features such as branching, subroutines, and pipeline mechanisms.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git installed on your system

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aqib2607/Virtual_CPU_Emulator.git
   cd Virtual_CPU_Emulator
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the emulator:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

### Running Tests
Run the unit tests to verify the installation:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

## Usage
- Use the assembler to write and test simple assembly programs:
  ```bash
  python src/assembler/assembler.py examples/simple_program.asm
  ```
- Execute the emulator with the assembled machine code:
  ```bash
  python src/main.py
  ```

### Example Assembly Code
```assembly
LOAD R1, 0x1000
ADD R2, R1, 10
STORE R2, 0x1001
```
