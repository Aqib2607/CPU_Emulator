# I/O Operations

## Week 6: I/O Operations

### Objective:
- Enable basic input/output operations.

### Tasks:
1. **Implement simulated I/O devices**:
   - Simulate I/O devices like keyboard input and display output.

2. **Create I/O instructions**:
   - Implement I/O-specific instructions, such as `IN` (input from a device) and `OUT` (output to a device).

3. **Integrate I/O operations with the CPU**:
   - Allow the CPU to read from or write to the simulated I/O devices.
