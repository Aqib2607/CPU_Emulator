# Final Testing & Debugging

## Week 9: Final Testing & Debugging

### Objective:
- Thoroughly test and debug the emulator.

### Tasks:
1. **Test with a variety of assembly programs**:
   - Run multiple test programs to ensure the CPU emulates instructions correctly.

2. **Debug and fix any issues**:
   - Identify and resolve bugs related to instruction execution, memory management, or I/O handling.

3. **Validate performance against benchmarks**:
   - Compare emulator performance with expected outcomes and adjust as needed.
