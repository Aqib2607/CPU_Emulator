# Project Plan

## Week 1: Project Planning & Setup

### Objective:
- Define project scope, gather resources, and set up the development environment.

### Tasks:
1. **Outline the features of the virtual CPU**:
   - Simulate core components of a CPU: ALU, registers, memory.
   - Implement an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for basic operations (ADD, SUB, LOAD, STORE, etc.).
   - Create a simple assembler to convert assembly code to machine code.
   - Develop basic I/O functionality for simulated devices (keyboard, display).

2. **Choose a programming language and tools**:
   - **Python** was selected for simplicity and flexibility in implementing CPU emulation.
   - **VS Code** or **PyCharm** for development.
   - **GitHub** for version control and collaboration.

3. **Set up version control**:
   - Initialized a GitHub repository.
   - Established a branching strategy with the main branch for production code and separate feature branches for each task.

### Resources:
- Documentation on CPU architecture and instruction sets.
- Python libraries like `pytest` for testing and `numpy` for potential numerical operations.
