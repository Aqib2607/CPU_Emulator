# Performance Optimization

## Week 8: Performance Optimization

### Objective:
- Optimize the emulator for better performance.

### Tasks:
1. **Profile the emulator**:
   - Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in CPU execution and memory handling.

2. **Optimize critical code paths**:
   - Refactor slow or inefficient code sections for faster execution.

3. **Enhance the assembler**:
   - Improve the assembler to generate more efficient machine code.
